# MidiReader
 
This project was an experiment to implement a non-Unity oriented C# library in Unity and use that to create an interesting editor tool.

#### DryWetMidi
The library I chose was DryWetMidi. This library is a Midi reading and writing library. I used this to make a tool that can open Midi files within Unity and play audio based on its contents.
